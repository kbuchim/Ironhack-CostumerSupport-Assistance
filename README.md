# Assistance to Customer Support Department

This is the README file for the final project of Karina BÃ¼chi, a student in the Data Analytics Part-Time program at Barcelona, April 2023.

# Question
The objective of this project is to aid the customer support department in responding to client queries and issues effectively. The project seeks to leverage machine learning techniques to achieve this goal.

# Project Description and Workflow
The project involves using Natural Language Processing (NLP) models to process customer queries and complaints. The main tool used is the Transformer, a deep learning model that has shown excellent performance in a variety of NLP tasks. The project also utilizes the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK), an open-source library that provides tools for processing human language data.

The project includes an API provided by OpenAI, which is used to train the NLP models. Additionally, the project features a Streamlit application that provides a user-friendly interface for the customer support team to interact with the NLP models.

# The workflow for the project is as follows:

Gather customer queries and complaints in a PDF file.
Preprocess the text data using NLTK.
Train the Transformer model using the OpenAI API.
Deploy the model using Streamlit.
Provide customer support representatives with access to the Streamlit application.
Customer support representatives input customer queries into the application.
The NLP model processes the input and generates a response.
The response is displayed to the customer support representative, who can then provide it to the customer.
